# blogCMS

A simple blog content management system app where you can make, edit, and delete blog posts. Final project for CS602 Server Side Development, built with the MERN Stack.

It can be viewed [here](https://notes-blog-cms.herokuapp.com/)!

Looking back on it I would do almost everything diffeently, from the way I organized my code to how I wrote my components. It's a little all over the place so one day I'll go back to it and clean it up.
